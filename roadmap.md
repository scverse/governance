# scverse roadmap

Work in progress.

## 2023

### Data standards

- [ ] MuData enhancements with new methods incl. [concatenation](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/concatenation.html)
- [ ] Improved out-of-memory analysis for AnnData and MuData
- [ ] [Awkward array](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/) support for AnnData

### Genomics

- [ ] Genomic ranges support for scverse ecosystem
- [ ] Indtroducing genome information and sequence into muon and other scverse tools
- [ ] Modular chromatin accessibility data processing and analyses in the scverse ecosystem

### Spatial omics

- [ ] Flexible data structure for spatial omics
- [ ] Support for the new spatial data structure in the analysis tools
- [ ] Framework for spatial omics and multi-omics

### Adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR) data

- [ ] Improved data structured based on [awkward arrays](https://awkward-array.org/doc/main/)
- [ ] Improve scalability to >1M receptors
- [ ] Tighten integration with ecosystem tools, e.g. [dandelion](https://sc-dandelion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest), [mvTCR](https://github.com/SchubertLab/mvTCR)

### Documentation
- [ ] New tutorial website (work in progress see github.com/scverse/scverse-tutorials/)

### Events

- [ ] (March) Hackathon with a focus on interoperability
