## NumFOCUS

Internal documentation on NumFOCUS and the financial processes can be found on our shared drive.
We are managing our funds through our NumFOCUS account which is connected to the [scverse Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/scverse).
Isaac and Lukas, together with 4 people from NumFOCUS, are admins of the Open Collective account.
Any reimbursements have to be approved by either Isaac or Lukas that only play an executory role here.
All decisions on how money is spent are jointly made by the core team.

## Donations

We are collecting donations through NumFOCUS.
More information on [how to donate to scverse](https://numfocus.org/donate-to-scverse).
The donation is tax-deductible because NumFOCUS is a non-profit.
Consider pointing this out to interested parties.

## Reimbursement process

### Requesting reimbursements

Any expenses that do not exceed 100$ are automatically approved.
If your reimbursement request exceeds 100$, post your request on the "reimbursements" topic in the core zulip chat.
All members of the core team have 72 hours to review and object to your request.
If no objections are raised within this time frame, your request will be automatically approved.

### Submitting reimbursement requests

1. Upload the receipt to our Google Drive (scverse -> numfocus -> reimbursements) for documentation reasons.
   PDFs or phone camera pictures suffice. It is not required to have scverse or NumFOCUS on the receipt.
2. [Submit your expense request](https://opencollective.com/scverse/expenses/new) by selecting "reimbursements" and entering all required details.
   [More information on submitting expenses](https://docs.opencollective.com/help/expenses-and-getting-paid/submitting-expenses).
3. Wait for Isaac or Lukas to approve your request.
   If the request has not been approved within 48 hours, message them on zulip.
4. The reimbursement process may take up to 30 days.
   If you haven't received your funds after 30 days, please consider reaching out to the NumFOCUS finance team for assistance.
